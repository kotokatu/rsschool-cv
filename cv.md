# About Me
___
I first became interested in computer science when I got my first desktop back in 2001, but at that moment I was already a Linguistics major, so I never pursued CS field as a career. After having worked for an international forest industry corporation for 15 years I decided to change my career path to something that feels more satisfying and authentic to me. Becoming a Front-end developer  has become my dream and my goal.
