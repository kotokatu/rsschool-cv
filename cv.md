# About Me

I first became interested in computer science when I got my first desktop back in 2001, but at that moment I was already a Linguistics major, so I never pursued the CS field as a career. After having worked as a purchasing specialist for an international forest industry company for 15 years I decided to switch my career path to something that feels more satisfying and authentic. Becoming a Front-End developer has become my personal challenge, my dream and my goal.

##### Codewars 7 kyu: Descending Order
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
````
function descendingOrder(n){
  return +n.toString().split('').sort().reverse().join('');
}
````
